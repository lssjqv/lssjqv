Hi, Iâ€™m @lssjqv [ocrueocomido@proton.me] - I'm merely a linux user on the road to become a power user.
Also, I'm Currently learning css and html while tinkering with other things.
If you found this repo by typing gibberish in the search bar, thanks for stopping by!
For now, I'll be using this to learn how to deal with git repos and whatnot.
bye.
